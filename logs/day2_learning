# Day 2 â€” 2025-09-20

**Goals for today**
- Clean and explore missing values
- Visualize feature correlations with a heatmap
- Split data into training and testing sets

**What I did**
- Used `df.isnull().sum()` and `df.describe()` to analyze missing data and get a statistical summary.
- Cleaned the `in_shazam_charts` column by filling missing values with zeros.
- Generated a correlation heatmap using `seaborn` to understand relationships between features.
- Separated features (X) and target (y).
- Split the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data using `train_test_split`.

**Errors & Fixes**
- No major errors today, as the data was successfully loaded in Day 1.

**What I learned**
- The importance of data cleaning and how to handle missing values.
- How to interpret a correlation heatmap to make informed decisions about feature selection.
- The fundamental concept of splitting data to prevent a model from overfitting.
